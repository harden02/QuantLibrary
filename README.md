Library of common tools created from my momentum project: https://github.com/harden02/Quant_Momentum
Most of the methods from the previous project have been packaged up to become a (very specific) library for use in further work I do. 

You can find some S&P500 price data csvs created from the datadownloader file. The datasetcreator is used to import these csvs into a pandas dataframe containing raw or logarithmic returns. There are further scripts for analysing momentum of the group of equities, or calculating the stochastic oscillator etc. These can all be used to create a dataframe of "long" positions which will then be tested with the trade_test.
